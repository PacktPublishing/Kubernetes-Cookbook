## What you need for this book
Throughout the book, we have used at least three servers with a Linux-based OS to build 
all the components in Kubernetes. You could use one system to install all of them at the 
beginning. As for the scalability point of view, we recommend you to start with three servers 
in order to scale out the components independently.
